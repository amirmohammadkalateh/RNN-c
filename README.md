Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Explained for Sequential DataRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a specialized class of neural networks designed specifically for processing sequential data like text, speech, and time series.The core feature of an RNN is its recurrent connection, allowing the network to use the output or Hidden State ($h$) from a previous time step as an additional input for the current step.This mechanism provides the network with a form of memory, enabling it to capture temporal dependencies and context within the sequence.The network is conceptually viewed as a single computational unit that is unfolded over time to represent a sequence of operations.In the unfolded structure, the weight matrices $U$ (input weights), $W$ (recurrent weights), and $V$ (output weights) are shared across all time steps.The Hidden State ($h^{(t)}$) at any time $t$ is calculated using the new input ($x^{(t)}$) and the previous hidden state ($h^{(t-1)}$) through the equation: $h^{(t)} = \tanh(b + W h^{(t-1)} + U x^{(t)})$.The final output prediction ($y^{(t)}$) is then computed based on the current hidden state: $o^{(t)} = c + V h^{(t)}$.Unlike Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), which treat inputs independently, RNNs utilize this internal loop to maintain context, making them ideal for tasks like Natural Language Processing (NLP).However, standard RNNs face the challenge of vanishing gradients, which limits their ability to learn long-range dependencies in very long sequences.To overcome this limitation, advanced architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are generally preferred for most modern sequence tasks.
